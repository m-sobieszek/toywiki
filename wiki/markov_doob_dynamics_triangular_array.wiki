%title Markov-Doob integrable dynamics on triangular arrays

:markov_doob_integrability:

We give a classification of dynamics on the triangular array that are [[markov_doob_integrability_triangular_array|Markov-Doob integrable]] here.

We consider four parameters with their possible values in braces:
* Space: The triangular array may be on a discrete space (d) e.g. $\pint$, or continuous space (c) e.g. $\real_+$.
* Type: The dynamics might be [[rsk_type_dynamics|RSK-type]] (r), which is weight preserving, or Warren-type (w).
* Function: The special harmonic function $h$ may be the Schur polynomials (s), the $q$-Whittaker functions (q), the Macdonald polynomials (m), or the Whittaker functions (w).
* Special: And the functions may have specialisations, including the usual specialisation / usual-spec (u), the dual specialisation / dual-spec (d), or the exponential specialisation / exp-spec (e).

So in total the possibile dynamics are 4-tuples in {d, c} x {r, w} x {s, q, m, w} x {u, d, e}, ranging 48 possibilities!

*Remark 1*. The RSK-type dynamics can further split into row- and column- insertions. However for now we do not consider them separately, because
1. They are dual to each other in a rather trivial sense in many cases
2. There are "canonical" choices in many cases. For example, for usual-spec dynamics row insertion is usually more natural than column insertion, and for exp-spec dynamics column insertion more natural than row insertions.

*Remark 1.5*. Both the Schur and $q$-Whittaker functions are special cases of the Macdonald polynomials, but we do not neglect the former two because
1. Macdonald-related dynamics are still open
2. The Schur cases are less messy than the $q$-case, and have their own merits. This is also the reason we do not neglect Whittaker-related dynamics even though they are limits of the $q$-cases.

Let us list them all (.: wildcard, ?: open, x: likely nonexistent, -: may be out there somewhere):

*Remark 2*. The [[markov_doob_integrability_triangular_array|Markov-Doob integrability]] given Space, Function, and Special has the same statement with the same transition kernels of the shape. Therefore for any x, y and z, the combination xryz and xwyz yield the same Corollary [[markov_doob_integrability_triangular_array|there]].

[1]. Not likely to exist because the Whittaker functions are usually defined on continuous space.

[2]. Not likely to exist becasue need to find a continuous version of the $q$-Geometric distribution, which is weird.

[3]. TODO: Is this the Laguerre Warren process in [{sun16}]?
