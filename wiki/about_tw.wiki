%title Welcome to toywiki

by Yuchen Pei

(1) toywiki hosts a collection of research notes on mathematics.

(2) I wrote these notes to help myself solidify my mathematical knowledge and share my research.

(3) toywiki is also an experimental open-source project. 
It is synchronised with [[https://github.com/ycpei/toywiki|a Github repository]].
You are welcome to do open-sourcy things with it too: fork, submit an issue, submit a pull request etc.
Collaborations, whether original research or not, should be preferably [[https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/|open-source contributions]].
For example, all communication should be as public as possible, unless it involves sensitive information or that you are unfamiliar with Github.

(4) Style-wise, toywiki notes are meant to give a modular and intuitive presentation.

(5) I believe mathematical knowledge is highly modular and incremental,
and that mathematical writing is not much dissimilar to computer programming.
For example here is a table of some analogues between mathematical writing and programming.

| Mathematical writing                         | Computer programming                         |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Theorems, lemmas, propositions, corollaries  | Functions and procedures                     |
| Lemmas                                       | Helper functions                             |
| Invoking a theorem                           | Calling a function                           |
| Examples                                     | Test cases                                   |
| Papers, notes, books                         | Libraries and modules                        |
| Citing a paper, book etc.                    | Importing a library                          |
| Declaring a variable                         | Declaring a variable                         |
| Variables have scopes (e.g. dummy variables) | Variables have scopes (e.g. local variables) |

On toywiki, I try to abide by the modularity to write as few repeated statements as possible and improve the clarity and simplicity of the demonstration.

It is really like a programming project, except the computer can not help debug and find errors (see (7)).

(6) Despite the inspiration from computer programming, on toywiki formality is secondary to clarity, simplicity or efficiency.
For example, I do not attempt to formalise mathematics completely or automate theorem proving.

(7) Since the notes are informal and haven't been peer-reviewed yet, I expect there to be mistakes and typos on accuracy or attributions. 
If you find something fishy or outright wrong, open an issue or submit a pull request on Github. 
You are also welcome to open an issue if you have a question about any of the notes. 
You can also reach me by email (see the footer of this page) if you have any comments about the project itself.

(8) I hope you find something useful here.

However, the attribution rule does *not* apply if you want to use any content in a formal academic setting: e.g. in a research paper. 
In this case please send me an email if you are thinking of attributing me, so that I can check the accuracy and attributions.

(10) Oh, and why is it called toywiki? Because I think toy examples are the best tool to study mathematics :)
