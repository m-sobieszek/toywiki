:representation_theory:toy_model:

The goal of this note is to give a concise account of representation theory of $\fsl_n = \fsl(n; \cplx)$, and to show that the dimension of a irreducible finite-dimensional representation of $\fsl_n$ is the number of semistandard Young of certain shapes with entries in $[n]$, and that the characters of these representations are the Schur functions.

We mostly follow the amazing textbook [{hall03}].

We first give an overview of the representation theory of complex semisimple (matrix) Lie algebras containing the classical Lie algebras of $\fsl_n$, $\fso_n$ and $\fsp_n$ by listing all its elements that are necessary in deriving the connection with Young tableaux and Schur functions, and then we match all these elements in the toy model of $\fg = \fsl_n$.

== Representations of complex semisimple Lie algebras ==
Let $\Ad_H$ be an operator defined by $\Ad_H X := [H, X]$.

Here are the elements of representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebra $\fg$:

* An inner product on $\fg$. We use Hilbert-Schmidt inner products $\braket{X, Y} = \Tr (X^* Y)$ for matrix Lie algebras.
* Cartan subalgebra $\fh$: A maximal commutative algebra $\fh$ where $\Ad_H$ is diagonalisable for each $H \in \fh$.
* Root $\alpha \in \fh$ and corresponding root vector $X \in \fg$, defined by the relation
  {{$
  [H, X] = \braket{\alpha, H} X, \qquad \forall H \in \fh
  }}$
  The set of roots is denoted by $R$.
* Given a representation $(\pi, V)$, define weight $\mu \in \fh$ and corresponding weight vector $v \in V$ by the relation
  {{$
  \pi(H) v = \braket{\mu, H} v, \qquad \forall H \in \fh
  }}$
  so that the roots and root vectors are weights and weight vectors where $\pi: X \mapsto \Ad_X$ is the adjoint representation.
* The roots span a real space $E$.
  We estblish a partial ordering on $E$.
    * Base $\Delta \subset R$: a subset of $R$ and a basis of $E$, such that $\forall \alpha \in R$, $\alpha$ expressed as a linear combination of $\Delta$ have all nonnegative or all nonpositive coefficients.
    * For $x \in E$, $x$ is dominant if $x$ expressed as a linear combination of $\Delta$ have all nonnegative coefficients.
    * For $x, y \in E$, $x$ is said to be lower than $y$ (denoted as $x \preceq y$) if $y - x$ is dominant.
    * Let $R^+ = \{\alpha \in R: \alpha \text{ is dominant}\}$ be the set of positive roots.
    * Let $\delta = {1 \over 2}\sum_{\alpha \in R^+} \alpha$ be the half sum of the positive roots.
* $x \in E$ is called integral if for any $\alpha \in R$, $2 {\braket{x, \alpha} \over \braket{\alpha, \alpha}} \in \intg$.
  Any weight of a finite representation of $\fg$ is integral.
* Weyl group $W$ is the group generated by the reflections $s_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in R$, where $s_\alpha$ is defined by its action on $E$ as $I - 2 P_\alpha$ as follows:
  {{$
  s_\alpha \beta = \beta - 2 {\braket{\alpha, \beta} \over \braket{\alpha, \alpha}} \alpha.
  }}$
* Given a representation $(\pi, V)$ of $\fg$, the character
  {{$
  \chi_\pi (X) := \Tr e^{\pi (X)}
  }}$
  and so the dimension of $V$ is $\chi_\pi (0)$.

*The Big Theorem*. Irreducible finite-dimensional representation (IFDR) of $\fg$ are characterised by highest weights:
* Every IFDR of $\fg$ has a highest weight, which is dominant integral, and for every dominant integral $\mu$ there is an IFDR of $\fg$ with highest weight $\mu$.
* Two IFDRs of $\fg$ with the same highest weight are isomorphic.

*Theorem* (The Weyl character and dimensional formulas). Let $(\pi, V_\mu)$ be the IFDR of $\fg$ with highest weight $\mu$, and let $\chi_\mu$ be the corresponding character. Then
{{$%align%
\chi_\mu (H) &= {\sigma_{w \in W} \det(w) e^{\braket{w \cdot (\mu + \delta), H}} \over \sigma_{w \in W} \det(w) e^{\braket{w \cdot \delta, H}}}. \\
\dim V_\mu &= {\prod_{\alpha \in R^+} \braket{\alpha, \mu + \delta} \over \prod_{\alpha \in R^+} \braket{\alpha, \delta}}.
}}$

== IFDR of $\fsl_n$ ==
* $\fh = \{\diag(\lambda_{1 : n}) : \lambda_i \in \cplx, \lambda_1 + ... + \lambda_n = 0 \}$ are diagonal matrices with trace $0$.
* The roots are $E_{ii} - E_{jj}$ with root vectors $E_{ij}$:
  {{$
  [H, E_{ij}] = (\lambda_i - \lambda_j) E_{ij} = \braket{E_{ii} - E_{jj}, H} E_{ij}
  }}$
* Hence $E = \{(x_1, ..., x_n) \in \real^n: \sum_i x_i = 0\}$ with the standard product of $\real^n$, and the root $E_{ii} - E_{jj}$ is identified as $e_i - e_j$ in $E$.
* The positive simple roots are $\Delta = \{e_i - e_{i + 1}: i = 1 : n - 1\}$.
* The positive roots are of the form $e_i - e_j$ for $1 \le i < j \le n$.
* $\delta = {1 \over 2} \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} (e_i - e_j) = ((n - 1) / 2, (n - 1) / 2 - 1, ..., 1 - (n - 1) / 2, - (n - 1) / 2)$.
* The Weyl group $S_n$ is the $n$th symmetric group, thus $\det w = \sgn w$.
* The highest weights / dominant integral elements are of the form $\mu = (\mu_1, \mu_2, ..., \mu_n) \in \intg^n$ such that $\mu_i \ge \mu_{i + 1}$ for all $i = 1 : n - 1$.
* By the Weyl dimensional formula
  {{$
  \dim V_{\mu} = {\prod_{1 \le i < j \le n} (\mu_i - \mu_j + \delta_i - \delta_j) \over \prod_{1 \le i < j \le n} (\delta_i - \delta_j)} = {\prod_{1 \le i < j \le n} (\mu_i - \mu_j + j - i) \over \prod_{1 \le i < j \le n} (j - i)}.
  }}$
  And the right hand side is the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape $(\mu_1 + N, \mu_2 + N, ..., \mu_n + N)$ for $N$ sufficiently large with entries in $[n]$.
* For $H = \diag(\lambda_{1 : n})$, identify $H$ with $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n) \in E$. By the Weyl character formula and using the fact $\sum_i\lambda_i = 0$,
  {{$%align%
  \chi_\mu (H) &= {\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) e^{\sum_i (\mu_{\sigma_i} + {n + 1 \over 2} - \sigma_i) \lambda_i} \over \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) e^{\sum_i ({n + 1 \over 2} - \sigma_i) \lambda_i}}\\
  &= {\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) e^{\sum_i (\mu_{\sigma_i} + n - \sigma_i) \lambda_i} \over \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) e^{\sum_i (n - \sigma_i) \lambda_i}}\\
  &= {\det (e^{\lambda_i})^{\mu_j + n - j} \over \det (e^{\lambda_i})^{n - j}} = s_\mu(x)
  }}$
  where $x_i = e^{\lambda_i}$.
