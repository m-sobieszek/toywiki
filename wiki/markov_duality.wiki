:markov_processes:duality:

*Definition*. Markov processes $X$ and $Y$ are dual with respect to function $H$ if
{{$
\expe_{X_0 = x} H(X_t, y) = \expe_{Y_0 = y} H(x, Y_t).
}}$
When $X$ and $Y$ have generator $L^X$ and $L^Y$, this is equivalent to
{{$
L^X H(x, y) = L^Y H(x, y).
}}$
This equivalence can be seen by taking $\partial_t|_{t = 0}$ and noting the initial condition is tautology ($H(x, y) = H(x, y)$).

We derive the duality between $q$-TASEP and $q$-TAZRP, and between ASEP occupation and location processes. 
These results can be found in e.g. [{borodin-corwin-sasamoto14}].

== duality between $q$-TASEP and $q$-TAZRP ==
:qTASEP:qTAZRP:duality:

Let $X$ be $q$-TASEP with $N$ particles, and $Y$ be $q$-TAZRP with $N$ sites.
More specifically, $X_k$ is the location of $k$th particle of $q$-TASEP and $Y_k$ is the number of particles at site $k$.
Let $a_i$ be the rate of jumps by the $i$th particle in $q$-TASEP, and of from site $i$ to site $i - 1$ in $q$-TAZRP.

The generator of $q$-TASEP is
{{$
L^X f(x) = \sum_i a_i (1 - q^{x_{i - 1} - x_i - 1}) (f(x + e_i) - f(x))
}}$
and that of $q$-TAZRP is
{{$
L^Y f(x) = \sum_i a_i (1 - q^{y_i}) (f(y - e_i + e_{i - 1}) - f(y))
}}$

Let
{{$
H(x, y) = \prod_{i = 1 : N} q^{(x_i + i) y_i}.
}}$

*Claim*. $X$ and $Y$ are dual w.r.t. $H$.

*Proof*.
{{$
L^X H(x, y) = \sum_i a_i (1 - q^{x_{i - 1} - x_i - 1}) (q^{y_i} - 1) H(x, y) = L^Y (x, y).
}}$
$\square$.

== duality between ASEP occupation and location processes ==
:ASEP:duality:

Let $\eta$ be the occupation process of ASEP with rate $p$ to the right and $q$ to the left:
{{$
L^\eta f(\eta) = \sum_i p \eta_i (1 - \eta_{i + 1}) (f(\eta - e_i + e_{i + 1}) - f(\eta)) + q (1 - \eta_i) \eta_{i + 1} (f(\eta - e_{i + 1} + e_i) - f(\eta)).
}}$
and $X$ be the location process of ASEP with rate $p$ to the left and $q$ to the right:
{{$
L^X f(x) = \sum_{i \in l(x)} p (f(x - e_i) - f(x)) + \sum_{i \in r(x)} q (f(x + e_i) - f(x)),
}}$
where $l(x) = \{i : x_{i - 1} + 1 < x_i\}$ and $r(x) = \{i : x_i + 1 < x_{i + 1}\}$ are the left and right edges of clusters.

Let
{{$%align%
\tau &= p / q\\
N_x (\eta) &= \sum_{i \le x} \eta_i\\
H(\eta, x) &= \prod_i \tau^{N_{x_i} (\eta)} \qquad (1) \\
G(\eta, x) &= \prod_i \tau^{N_{x_i - 1} (\eta)} \eta_{x_i}
}}$

*Claim 1*. $X$ and $\eta$ are dual w.r.t. both $H$ and $G$.

*Proof*. Let us consider $G$ first.
We consider one $x$-cluster $x_{l : r}$.
Locally, there are 5 cases when at least one of the summands in $L^\eta G$ or $L^X G$ is nonzero.
We use crosses on the horizontal axis to denote the $x$-particles, and lines to denote the profile of $\eta$.
That is, $\eta = 0$ wherever the line touches the horizontal axis and $\eta = 1$ wherever the line is above the horizontal axis.
Here are the 5 cases.

* Case 1:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-35-23__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* Case 2:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-36-01__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* Case 3:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-35-44__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* Case 4:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-38-38__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* Case 5:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-37-54__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

In case 1 2 and 3 $x_{l : r}$ is fully covered by $\eta$. $G(x, \eta)$ is locally nonzero, but when $\eta$ is altered slightly, in case 2 and 3 $G$ may be zero.

In case 4 (resp. 5) all but $x_r$ (resp. $x_l$) is covered. $G(x, \eta)$ is zero, but when $\eta$ or $x$ is altered slightly, $G$ may become locally nonzero.

It suffices to consider one $x$-cluster $x_{l : r}$.

In case 1:
{{$
L^\eta G(\eta, x) = 0 
}}$
Consider $L^X G(\eta, x)$.
* The term corresponding to $x_l$ jumping to the left is $p G(\eta, x) (\tau^{-1} - 1) = (q - p) G(\eta, x)$. This will also appear in Case 3.
* The term corresponding to $x_r$ jumping to the right is $q G(\eta, x) (\tau - 1) = (p - q) G(\eta, x)$. This will also appear in Case 2.
Therefore
{{$
L^X G(\eta, x) = (q - p) G(\eta, x) + (p - q) G(\eta, x) = 0.
}}$

In case 2:
{{$%align%
L^\eta G(\eta, x) &= - q G(\eta, x)\\
L^X G(\eta, x) &= - p G(\eta, x) + (p - q) G(\eta, x) = - q G(\eta, x).
}}$

Similarly in Case 3:
{{$%align%
L^\eta G(\eta, x) &= - p G(\eta, x) = L^x G(\eta, x)\\
}}$

In case 4:
{{$
L^\eta G(\eta, x) = q G(\eta - e_{x_r + 1} + e_{x_r}, x) = q G(\eta, x + e_r) = L^X G(\eta, x)
}}$

In case 5:
{{$
L^\eta G(\eta, x) = p G(\eta - e_{x_l - 1} + e_{x_l}) = p G(\eta, x - e_l) = L^X G(\eta, x).
}}$
This concludes the proof that $G$ is a duality function.
Now let us turn to $H$.
In terms of $L^\eta$ there are two cases where $H(x, \eta)$ changes and has nonzero corresponding summands:

* E1. For some $x_i$ in the $X$-process, $\eta_{x_i} = 0$, $\eta_{x_i + 1} = 1$. 
  In other words, there is an $X$-particle just to the left of the left edge of an $\eta$-cluster. 
  Then the $\eta$-particle jumps to the left.

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-45-47__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* E2. For some $x_i$ in the $X$-process, $\eta_{x_i} = 1$, $\eta_{x_i + 1} = 0$. 
  In other words, there is an $X$-particle on the right edge of an $\eta$-cluster. 
  Then the $\eta$-particle jumps to the right.

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-47-08__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

The summands are respectively
{{$%align%
q (\tau - 1) H(x, \eta) &= (p - q) H(x, \eta) \\
p (\tau^{-1} - 1) H(x, \eta) &= (q - p) H(x, \eta)
}}$

In terms of $L^X$ there are also two cases, which are in a sense dual to the $L^\eta$. 
We use circles to denote empty site in the $X$-process.

* X1. For some site $x$ in the $\eta$-process, $\eta_x = 1$, there is an $x_i = x - 1$ of the $X$-process, but no $X$-particle at $x$. 
  In other words, there is an $\eta$-particle just to the right of the right edge of an $X$-cluster.
  Then the $x_i$ particle jumps to the right.

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-54-42__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* X2. For some site $x$ in the $\eta$-process, $\eta_x = 1$, there is an $x_i = x$ of the $X$-process, but no $X$-particle at $x - 1$. 
  In other words, there is an $\eta$-particle on the left edge of an $X$-cluster.
  Then the $x_i$ particle jumps to the left.

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-54-09__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

These two cases also correspond to
{{$%align%
(p - q) H(x, \eta) \\
(q - p) H(x, \eta)
}}$
respectively.

Now consider one $X$-cluster. We can pair the two cases $E_1$ and $E_2$ in $L^\eta$ and removing the corresponding portions (since the contribution of $E_1$ and $E_2$ cancels each other) to reduce the configuration without $\eta$-"valleys" or -"hills".

For example here is such a pairing, and everything in the red frame can be removed, reducing the configuration to case 3 in the following.

{{local:../resource/2017-06-15--15-18-53__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png}}

we are left with verifying the duality in the following 4 cases wihtout "valleys" or "mountains":

* case 1:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-58-21__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* case 2:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-58-34__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* case 3:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-59-06__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

* case 4:

{{local:../resource/2017-03-15--14-59-21__New_document_1_-_Inkscape.png||style="width:250px"}}

All of them are easily verified:
* In case 1 and 2, $L^\eta H = L^x H = 0$.
* In case 3, $L^\eta H = L^x H = (q - p) H$.
* In case 4, $L^\eta H = L^x H = (p - q) H$.
$\square$

*Remark*. Note that duality does *not* hold in the ASEP case if, as in the $q$TASEP case we introduce the bond jump rate parameters $a_i$.
More specifically, duality does not hold for the following $L^\eta$, $L^X$, and $G$ as in (1):
{{$%align%
L^\eta f(\eta) &= \sum_i a_i p \eta_i (1 - \eta_{i + 1}) (f(\eta - e_i + e_{i + 1}) - f(\eta)) + a_i q (1 - \eta_i) \eta_{i + 1} (f(\eta - e_{i + 1} + e_i) - f(\eta))\\
L^X f(x) &= \sum_{i \in l(x)} a_{x_i - 1} p (f(x - e_i) - f(x)) + \sum_{i \in r(x)} a_{x_i} q (f(x + e_i) - f(x))
}}$
That is, for the $x_i$ particle in the $X$-process, the rate of jumping to the left is $a_{x_i - 1} p$ and to the right is $a_{x_i} q$; and for the $\eta$-process at site $x$, the rate of an unobstructed particle jumping to the left is $a_{x - 1} q$ and to the right $a_x p$. To see that $G$ is not a duality function, for example consider Case 2 in the proof of $G$ being the duality function in Claim 1.
{{$%align%
L^\eta G(\eta, x) = - q a_{x_{l} - 1} G(\eta, x)\\
L^X G(\eta, x) = (- p a_{x_l - 1} + (p - q) a_{x_r}) G(\eta, x).
}}$
They are not equal unless $p = q$ or all the $a_i$s are equal.
In fact if either of these conditions is satisfied, $G$ *is* a duality function.
