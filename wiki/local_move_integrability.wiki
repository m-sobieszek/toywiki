%title Local move integrability

(So far local moves are only seen in RSK, gRSK and $q$RSK, but let us try to generalise it. 
In generality "local move integrability" may not be a good name because $\rho$ does not have to decompose into mpas that are local, but let us keep it until we find some non-local type.)

(We do not know the local move integrability for either dual-spec algorithms or Warren-type processes so we don't generalise it above the usual-spec RSK-type algorithms.)

The local move integrability is a symmetric treatment to the usual-RSK-type integrabilities, and generalises the usual-RSK-type algorithms from taking matrix input, to taking tableaux input.

In the case of RSK algorithm it is related to the ocotahedron recurrence [{hopkins14}].

* Let $(s_{ij})_{i, j \ge 1} \in K^{\pint_{>0} \times \pint_{>0}}$ be an infinite array on $K$ (think of $K$ as real or integers).
* Let $\rho_{n, k}$ be a map on $s$ such that $\rho_{n, k}$ only alters the diagonal terms $(s_{n - i, k - i})_{i = 0 : n \wedge k - 1}$.
* Let $(w_{n, k})_{n, k \ge 1}$ be independent random variables with probability mass function $(p_{n, k})$, and we informally write $\prob(w_{n, k}) = p_{n, k}(w_{n, k})$.

For a partition $\Lambda$ with a growth sequence
{{$
  \emptyset \nearrow \Lambda(1) \nearrow \Lambda(2) \dots \nearrow \Lambda(N - 1) \nearrow \Lambda
}}$

We define $T_\Lambda$ by
{{$
  T_\Lambda = \rho_{\Lambda / \Lambda(N - 1)} \circ \dots \circ \rho_{\Lambda(2) / \Lambda(1)} \circ \rho_{\Lambda(1) / \emptyset}.
}}$

We assume this definition does not depend on the growth sequence.

* Let for any partition $\Lambda$ let $\mu_\Lambda(s)$ be a measure on $K^\Lambda$.

*Definition*. The local move integrability is
{{$
\sum_{w_{n, k}, s'} \prob(w_{n, k}) \mu_\Lambda(s') \prob(\rho_{\Theta / \Lambda} s' = s) = \mu_\Theta(s). \qquad (1)
}}$

*Theorem*. Given $A = (w_{n, k})$, the local move integrability implies
{{$
\prob(T_\Lambda A(\Lambda) = s) = \mu_\Lambda(s).
}}$

*Proof*. Just apply (1) recursively. $\square$

Examples of local move integrability include RSK, gRSK, $q$RSK and (hypothetically) Macdonald RSK.
